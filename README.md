# Image Resizer

This is a simple web application that allows you to resize images by specifying the maximum width and height. The application uses JavaScript to read the selected image file, resize it using HTML5 canvas, and display the resized image.

## Features

- Choose an image file to resize
- Specify the maximum width and height of the resized image
- Display the file size of the selected image
- Display the resized image in the browser

## Getting Started

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can then select an image file to resize by clicking the "Choose file" button and selecting a file from your local file system. Once you have selected a file, you can specify the maximum width and height of the resized image by entering values in the corresponding input fields. Finally, click the "Resize" button to resize the selected image.
